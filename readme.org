* 2 main ways to transfer data from cpu to gpu
1. attribute, get data via a vertex buffer
2. uniform (we will focus on uniform)
* Comparison btw attribute and uniform 
1. attributes are set per vertex, e.g. position attributes can be any kind of data. 
2. uniforms are set per draw. 
   - We can set uniform up before we call glDrawElements or glDrawArrays, etc.
* Change color in our rendering loop
